# MapSumDemo
Test problem set for AD325

# The Problem

Implement a program that will store a map of String keys and Integer values that will allow you to search for the sum of all values where the corresponding keys use the same prefixes. 
For example:
From the map {"apple":1, "ape":2, "alpha":3}, the mapSum.sum("ap") method should return 3.

Included in this package are the JUnit libraries for testing, an Abstract class that defines the methods you will need, and a test suite 
to test your implementation. Succesfully completing this exercise should should show the following from the compile and test script: 

`Your Test Results`
`Test Passed: 2`
`Tests Failed: 0`

# Instructions
- Clone this repository to a Windows workstation in the lab
- Create a new branch
- Implement the abstract class from ad325.mapSumProblem.mapSumClasses and it's abstract methods into a concrete class. 
- Use the provided windows .cmd file to compile and run the unit tests. 
- When all the test cases are passing, send a pull request to the repo.
